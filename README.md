# foodApp is test app created using react native

Some points to be addressed;
1. Map is not integrated as time was a contraint
2. In the detail view of both recipe and restaurant, I intentionally didn't make the header transparent since the images I am using were bright and the recipe/restaurant name and the back arrow was not clearly visible
3. Because of the Images issue mentioned earlier, I took some creative independence and added transparent black background to the titles of recipes/restaurants in both listing and detail screens
